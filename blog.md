# A Spooky, Funky Little Blog
###### Posted March 6th, 2024

Welcome to my first post on this developer blog! This has been made on behalf of Awesome Inc, so here I am to answer their questions. First, though, you are REQUIRED to look at my cat:

She's lovely, isn't she? My north star, my guiding moonlight... all this, I do for her...

...And, well, also because I enjoy coding, but I need a little extrinsic motivation too!

Onto the questions...

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

Not quite! But I didn't really know what to expect beyond what was on the course plan. I knew we would be learning Git, HTML, CSS, and JS in these first weeks, but I didn't think that we'd do that by building a blog on GitHub! I didn't even know that was an option GitHub offered.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

Primarily front-end development. I like being able to take what I learn and build things I can actually look at with my eyeballs. There is a certain amount of satisfaction to be had with managing a database or punching commands into a terminal, but I consider myself a fairly creative person and that drive needs to be expressed somehow.

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

Oh gosh, that's a tough question. I'm basically an open book about anything I'm comfortable with sharing. For lack of any better ideas I can tell you a bit more about myself:

* I'm an amateur game developer who has been coding since she was 15. My primary hobbies are writing, coding, and drawing, in that order! They're what I spend the lion's share of my time on. I also have some knowledge of sound design and music composition for the sake of gamedev. I don't find them all that engaging, though, so I found a wizard living out of a van to do that for me!
* I've used all of the above combined skills to make several games over the years, though I neglected to put any of them up online out of a combination of insecurity and them not being up to my standards of quality. Most of those projects would be hard for me to find now, as I didn't keep very good backups, and didn't really want to keep them to begin with.
* I'm currently working on a new game project (an RPG!), and have been for the last two years (at least when my crappy job wasn't tiring me out too much)! I recently finished the prototyping stage after an extensive period of building, playtesting, and iterating, and I'm currently moving into production. Maybe you will see more about it later this year, assuming this bootcamp doesn't end up taking up all of my available time and energy I could use to work on it.

Here's a drawing of the main character of my current game, one of the sprites used in-game:

She's a little witch, and I think she's pretty cool. ;)

Hope that clears all of that up!
