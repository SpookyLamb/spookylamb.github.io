# Behold, My Psychic Power!

We completed our first real project! You can find my version of it at: [Mind Reader](https://spookylamb.github.io/mind-reader/)

Onto the usual questions...

##What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?

Lack of knowledge of Bootstrap and how it interacts with JavaScript and CSS, I think. There were lots of times that I was left very confused by its behavior and ended up using a lot of trial-and-error between reading docs.

##What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?

I think I have a very good understanding of Atomic Design, but I generally just want to get more familiar with the documentation for both JavaScript and especially Bootstrap. There's always more to learn and put into practice!

##What is your “Why”?

What a strange and open-ended question! Why I'm doing this bootcamp, I take it? Well the answer I keep giving is that I've been coding since I was a teenager and I want to turn that into a career. Simple as!
