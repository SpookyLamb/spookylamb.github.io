# Weather Report Wants To Know Your Location
###### Posted April 12th, 2024

We have completed our second project! Similarly to last week, you can find my version at: [Weather Forecast](https://spookylamb.github.io/weather-app/)

That brings me to this week's questions...

## What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

Oh man, I don't really know. I've been so familiar with development for so long that I think I've already got a very good understanding of it, nothing has really opened my eyes or been too different besides working with other people rather than on my own.

## What does it mean to develop good code?

Good code to me is code that is efficient, organized, readable, and most importantly, WORKS (without bugs)!

## What does it mean to be a good developer?

Being a good developer to me means that you get your work done on-time to the best of you ability, following good code practices, as above.

## What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

For me, it's trying to get something working when I don't actually understand *why*, and simply having to rely on faith that other people's solutions work. For other programmers, from what I have noticed... documenting their code and refactoring it when it's a slapdash solution that works but isn't readable, organized, or efficient.
