# Rising Action
###### Posted March 22nd, 2024

Three weeks down! We've covered the basics of JavaScript now, pretty much all of which I already knew and understood from prior use of the language (and other programming experience). That said, I'm happy to learn more!

Questions!

## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?

I find the way that they all interact with each other quite interesting. HTML is the bottom of the pyramid, the essential basis for the other two. CSS provides all the pretty graphics and page arrangement that actually makes pages nice to look at, and JavaScript provides all (or nearly all) of the actual interactivity. Without them adding onto the HTML, all we would have are static pages of barely formatted text, which would be pretty boring! I'm most excited to work with JavaScript since it's my comfort zone, but I'm also happy to learn CSS and have pages come to life.

## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

None right now, I'm pretty sure! Or, at least, none that I've put in. I haven't really dived into the code of how the Jekyll themes work, but I imagine that it must make some decent use of Objects. As for me, that will have to be saved for later, once I've got a clearer idea of how I can improve the blog with them! >:3
