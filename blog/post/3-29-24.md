# Onboarding Done!
###### Posted March 29th, 2024

Onboarding is done! I've quit my old, crappy job and now am moving forward with the bootcamp! Very excited to be in-person, less excited to now be on the day schedule after working nights for five years, but at least I've been slowly adjusting in preparation.

Question time!~

# What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

Being able to speak with everyone through slack and have the opportunity to look at everyone else's code to pick up on tips and tricks I wasn't able to find myself.

# What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

Time, mostly. I had to continue working my job part-time while participating so I didn't have as much time each week as I would've liked to work on things. Other than that, though, it was fairly easy to keep up and complete the tasks I was given.

# How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

Documentation. If that didn't work, Google. If THAT didn't work, the tried and true method of trial-and-error.
