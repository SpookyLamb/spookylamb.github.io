# Action, then Reaction
###### April 26th, 2024

We've learned React! This blog is using it now too! Very nice. This week's project was a Restaurant Menu, which you can find here: [The Summer Demon](https://spookylamb.github.io/random-restaurant/)

Also, last week we made a game! I made two. >:)

You can find that at [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://spookylamb.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) since it wasn't linked last week.

Questions, as always...

## Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

For me? Easy. I'm used to taking code that is free-to-use and using it to speed up my processes. There's always a learning curve when you're picking up something new and understanding all of its individual quirks, but it's not too much of a problem.

## What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

Good question. Nothing is coming to mind at the moment, but I'm sure something will pique my interest at some point.

## Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

Svelte seems fairly interesting. It's not that new but it's apparently one of the top frameworks in terms of developer satisfaction. TypeScript is not something I'm used to, but I'm sure I could learn it in due time.
