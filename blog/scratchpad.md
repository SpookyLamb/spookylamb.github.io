# Python & OOP
###### May 10th, 2024

This week we learned Python and the principles of Object Oriented Programming! That was something I was already very familiar with, so I'm afraid there was not much new I learned this week! But that's alright, it seems like the rest of my classmates learned a lot, and I was able to help a lot of them, so I'm happy on their behalf. :)

Question time, question time!

## Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?

Definitely React. While it wasn't that challenging to me, it was still a pretty noticeable jump in difficulty and something I actually had to buckle down and learn. Next biggest hurdle will probably be learning Django and back-end development next week, but I'm sure I'll manage. >:)

## Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations?

I think they're basically the same as before. Unfortunately I'm still struggling to come up with specific ideas for the final project, mostly because I don't know exactly what a potential employer would want to see as a demonstration of my skills. I'm still leaning towards the idea of making a game of some kind, to lean on my existing skills, but I'm not sure.

## What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript? 

Nothing much, actually! I learned Python way before I learned Javascript, so it was like seeing an old friend. :)
