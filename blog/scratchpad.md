# Tasks & CLIs
###### May 4th, 2024

We've continued learning react, applying it to a fairly advanced to-do list project for this week! You can find mine here: [To-Do List](https://todo-list-nine-phi-47.vercel.app/)

To answer the questions...

## What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?

Over the course of the bootcamp I can't say I've learned too much new about Command-Line Interfaces (yet) since I already used my terminal fairly regularly, but I have been making use of them a whole lot more! I don't think they're scary, just delicate. They're a lot like knives -- used incorrectly, they can cause great harm, but are otherwise extremely useful and versatile tools that can cut straight to the heart of a situation.

## If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?

That's hard! It'd really depend on the specific application and why I needed a CLI. I suppose the first thing that comes to mind would be a text-adventure game, ala Zork. I made one of those when I was in high-school, though I'm not sure I'd be able to find a copy now... 

## List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code

Pretty much anything on the modern internet. Dynamic online storefronts, social media applications, complex games especially would be agonizing to program without any kind of framework. Even something as basic as the blog you're reading this on! Frameworks are vital to the functioning of the internet as we know it.
