# SQL & Databases
###### May 18th, 2024

This week we ended up finally diving into the backend, learning SQL and how databases are generally structured, along with starting to dive into the Python framework, Django! It's quite exciting to finally arrive at material that I'm not already intimately familiar with.

Of course, this week, there are also questions, like any other...

## What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?

Well the big similarity that I immediately noticed is that they're both weakly/dynamically typed. The main (big) difference to me is that Python is very much object oriented while Javascript is multi-paradigm. I'm very comfortable with both, so it's no big deal!

## If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?

Eh, me personally? No, I wouldn't have benefited. I was already very familiar with Python before the bootcamp, and I've never actually made anything with Javascript, even if I knew how to use it. Being exposed to a whole world of coding that I understood wasn't directly familiar with was a treat!

## Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future? 

Well, with React, I imagine you could build all sorts of databases to interact with it. Something obvious that comes to mind is Facebook's own use of it, and how the database stores posts, images, etc for use with the front-end. I could definitely enjoy it, but I just love putting stuff together in general!
