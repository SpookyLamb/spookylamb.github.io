# Authentication, Security
###### June 2nd, 2024

This week was our second week of full-stack development! This time we made a catalog that tracks a user's personal books and library! Mine currently isn't deployed anywhere yet, but I'll be sure to update this post when that changes.

The main lesson this week was about user authentication and security. I'm glad that Django (and presumably similar frameworks) handles that on its own, I imagine making a system like that from scratch would be pretty hard!

Onto the question of the week...

## What has been your experience overall thus far? What would you want to post as a “retrospective”?

My experience with the bootcamp has been good, overall! I'm very happy with everything I've learned and practiced and feel fairly proud of my accomplishments. Getting into the job search has been tough, but that was always going to be the hardest part. The actual lessons and bootcamp overall have been lovely, and my fellow students have been a treat to be around.

Overall, I'm not sure there's anything major I would change about the approach! It's just a matter of getting through this and the final home stretch. :)
