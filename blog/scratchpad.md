# Finish Line
###### June 9th, 2024

This last week of bootcamp was our last project before our two-week final project! This week we made a mock social media site. I named mine [Chatterbox](https://chatterbox-six.vercel.app/), and you can find it at that link! Note that you'll have to make an account and log in if you want to see it! :)

As for this week's post...

## On Agile Development

I find Agile development to be fairly interesting as a development ethos/strategy. What exactly it means can be a tad vague and seemingly varies between organizations, but the core parts of it make a lot of sense for how to structure the development process.

You have your daily stand-ups where everyone meets and discusses what they've done in the last 24 hours and what they intend to do the next 24 hours, so everyone is kept up to date with what everyone else is doing, even if they're otherwise existing in their little developer bubbles.

You also have the actual weekly sprints, where everything is subdivided into smaller and smaller goals that can be achieved within that timeframe. Like scrubbing a bathroom floor, you do it one tile at a time! It helps keep everyone productive, without worry of being overwhelmed by the overall scope of the project.

Lastly, there's the retro at the end of a sprint where everyone goes over what worked and what didn't work that week. Thus, even the process itself is iterated on and improved for the future, with what worked being kept and what didn't work (hopefully) being discarded!

## On Frameworks

Frameworks are extremely useful for getting work done quickly and with minimal hassle. You might be tempted to work without a framework for the specific reason of having total control over what you're making, but in my experience that tends to be rather unnecessary. Frameworks like Bootstrap, React, and Django might be difficult to work with at times, but you can almost always bend them to behave exactly as you would otherwise like, so long as you understand them well enough.

The big benefit to using them though is that they save you an unfathomable amount of work. Why struggle with aligning elements with CSS when you could use Bootstrap? Why worry about updating parts of your document and stripping out or filling in new elements when you could let React do that for you? Why bother with the finnicky, painful SQL when you can let Django do all the heavy lifting?

These things were made to make a developer's life easier, so not using them (or an equivalent!) is just making your life harder for no reason.
